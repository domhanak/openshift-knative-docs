To install the Knative Workflow Plugin using the artifacts image you must follow this procedure:

*Start the `kn-workflow-cli-artifacts-rhel8` image*

[source, shell]
----
export KN_IMAGE=registry.redhat.io/openshift-serverless-1/logic-kn-workflow-cli-artifacts-rhel8:1.33.0

export KN_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run -di $KN_IMAGE)
----

*Copy the Knative Workflow Plugin binary according to your environment*

[source, shell]
----
docker cp $KN_CONTAINER_ID:/usr/share/kn/macos_amd64/kn-workflow-macos-amd64.tar.gz kn-workflow-macos-amd64.tar.gz

docker cp $KN_CONTAINER_ID:/usr/share/kn/macos_arm64/kn-workflow-macos-arm64.tar.gz kn-workflow-macos-arm64.tar.gz
----

.Binaries copy for `Windows` amd64 architecture
[source, shell]
----
docker cp $KN_CONTAINER_ID:/usr/share/kn/windows/kn-workflow-windows-amd64.zip kn-workflow-windows-amd64.zip
